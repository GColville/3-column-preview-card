## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about using variables in CSS to keep the styling sheet clean and the properties easily re-usable. I am gaining more confidence with CSS Flexbox for responsiveness.

### Continued development

I will continue to develop my styling skills, to ensure that my interpretations of the designs remains as accurate as possible.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to give a shout out to Frontend Mentor for being an amazing resource. Design isn't my strong point, and with worrying about design in the past this held me back a little from tru;y developing my skills. Now that I don't have to worry about the design as much, and can focus on the coding, my progress is much faster and better. Thanks again!
